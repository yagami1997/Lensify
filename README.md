## üåü Overview

</div>

<div align="center">
Lensify is a comprehensive calculator that helps photographers and cinematographers understand the complex relationships between sensor sizes, focal lengths, and apertures. Whether you're switching between cameras with different sensors or exploring the impact of changing lenses, Lensify provides precise calculations to help you visualize the results.
</div>

<div align="center">
Perfect for:
</div>

- Professional photographers comparing equipment across platforms
- Filmmakers planning shots with various camera systems
- Smartphone photographers exploring the capabilities of mobile sensors

<div align="center">

## ‚ú® Features

</div>

### üìê Sensor Size Calculations
- Support for **30+ sensor formats** from Medium Format to smartphone 1/4-inch sensors
- Accurate crop factor calculations with 2 decimal precision
- Dynamic equivalent sensor size determination when changing focal lengths

### üåì Aperture Equivalence
- F-stop conversion between different sensor formats
- Depth of field equivalence calculations
- Real-world light gathering comparisons

### üìè Focal Length Analysis
- Field of view changes when switching focal lengths
- Perspective compression/expansion effects
- Equivalent focal length matching across different sensor formats

### üöÄ Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with custom CSS styling
- **Backend**: Serverless Cloudflare Workers API
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Offline Support**: Local calculation fallbacks when API is unavailable

## üíª Technical Implementation

</div>

### Architecture Overview

Lensify follows a hybrid architecture that balances serverless computing with client-side functionality:

1. **Static Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS hosted on Cloudflare Pages
2. **API Backend**: Cloudflare Worker for calculations
3. **Resilient Design**: Fallback to local calculations when offline
4. **Global CDN**: Edge-deployed for fast access worldwide

This architecture enables Lensify to be both lightweight and powerful, with almost zero maintenance costs.

### Using the Calculators

#### Aperture Calculator
Calculate the equivalent aperture when using the same lens on different sensor sizes:

1. Select your sensor size (e.g., "APS-C")
2. Enter your aperture value (e.g., "f/2.8")
3. Get the full-frame equivalent aperture and depth of field

#### Focal Length Calculator
Understand what happens when you change focal lengths:

1. Choose your original sensor size
2. Enter original focal length
3. Enter new focal length
4. Input aperture value
5. View comprehensive results including:
   - Equivalent aperture
   - Field of view change
   - Perspective effect
   - Effective sensor size

### Example Calculations

| Scenario | Input | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| APS-C to Full Frame | f/2.8 on APS-C | f/4.2 equivalent on Full Frame |
| Focal Length Change | 50mm to 85mm on Full Frame | 70% perspective compression, -41.2% narrower field of view |
| Smartphone Camera | f/1.8 on 1/1.7-inch sensor | f/8.1 equivalent on Full Frame |

## üîß Installation & Deployment

</div>

Lensify uses Cloudflare's developer platform for fast, global deployment. Follow these steps to deploy your own instance:

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Step 1: Clone & Prepare

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lensify.git
cd lensify

# Prepare Worker file
cp worker.example.js worker.js
```

Edit `worker.js` and replace `example.pages.dev` with your Cloudflare Pages domain.

### Step 2: Deploy the Worker

```bash
# Log in to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Deploy the worker
wrangler deploy
```

Alternatively, you can deploy through the Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Navigate to Workers & Pages
2. Click "Create Application"
3. Select "Create Worker"
4. Name your Worker (e.g., "lensify-calculator")
5. Paste the content of your modified `worker.js`
6. Click "Save and Deploy"

### Step 3: Deploy the Frontend

#### Using Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. In the Cloudflare Dashboard, go to "Workers & Pages"
2. Click "Create Application" ‚Üí "Pages"
3. Connect your GitHub repository or upload directly
4. For build settings:
   - Build command: (leave empty for direct upload)
   - Build output directory: `public`
5. Click "Save and Deploy"

#### Using Direct Upload:
```bash
# Navigate to the Pages directory
cd public

# Deploy using Wrangler (if your site is already created)
wrangler pages publish .
```
